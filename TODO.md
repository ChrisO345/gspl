# TODO:

Full code refactoring using the revised simplex method:
- Refactor the code to use the revised simplex method for solving linear programming problems.
- Test for infeasibility and unboundedness.
- Use vectorisation for matrix operations to improve performance (will require a basic matrix struct and methods).
- Implement shadow value calculations via reduced costs.
- Add support for integer programming, and/or network flow problems.
- Implement a more sophisticated input parsing mechanism (e.g., from a file or command line arguments).
- Have ability to write output to a file.
